# Dealer
Deals and takes cards from players by deck
Syntax is !deal --[give,take] --[deck name]

If give/take is not specified, it gives a card to the player controlling the selected token
If deck name is not specified, it defaults to "Playing Cards"

Script will try to let you know if you have not prepared a command or deck properly

If deck does not deal a card, you may need to manually shuffle (Roll20 bug).
If the deck is shuffled, it may not recognize all cards in hand.
